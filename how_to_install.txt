How to install DataPro

0. Unzip the DataPro-release_7.10.zip file, which creates a folder called 
   DataPro-release_7.10.

1. Copy the folder DataPro-release_7.10 to the "Igor Pro 6 User Files"
   folder.  (You must copy the whole folder, not just the files within
   the folder.)

2. In experiments where you want to use this version of DataPro, add
   the line

     #include ":DataPro-release_7.10:DataPro"

   to the experiment's procedure file.  You can access this from the
   Igor Pro menu by going to
   Windows > Procedure Windows > Procedure Window.  (Note: You will
   have to do this for each experiment and/or template that you want
   to use this version of DataPro with.  Usually it's best to create a
   template where you've added the above line to the template's
   procedure file.)

If DataPro is installed correctly, you should have a
menu item called "DataPro" in the Igor Pro main menu.

To get started using DataPro, select "All Controls" from the "DataPro"
menu.
