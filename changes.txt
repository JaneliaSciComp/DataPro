7.00   (August 23, 2012)

Initial release of DataPro at Janelia Farm.





7.00 -> 7.01    (August 24, 2012)

Aquiring a sweep now updates all DataPro browser windows.

Reduced minimum y limits in Test Pulse Display from [-1,+1] to [-0.2,+0.2].

Updated installation instructions.





7.01 -> 7.02     (August 31, 2012)

Mainly code refactoring.  Some minor user-facing changes.





7.02 -> 7.03     (March 7, 2013)

Improved in many, many ways.  This release marks the completion of 
"Phase I" of the DataPro project at Janelia.





7.03 -> 7.04     (March 11, 2013)

Added a Switcher to work with Axon Instruments computer-controlled amplifier.
DataPro now gets initialized after a compile instead of on Igor Pro start up, 
which is more generally appropriate.

DataPro used to not allow you to turn of all input channels, or all output 
channels, in the Sweeper.  It now allows you to do this, but disables the 
Get Data until you turn on at least one input and one output channel.




7.04 -> 7.05    (May 14, 2013)

Made it easier for a single user to use different versions of DataPro
without going insane.




7.05 -> 7.06    (June 3, 2013)

Added Chirp Builder, Multiple Train Builder, Multiple TTL Train
Builder.  Split Train Builder in Train Builder and TTL Train Builder.
Renamed Step Builder to Stair Builder.  In general, each builder is
now designed for either analog output or TTL output, but not both.

Reimplemented how many of the builder outputs are constructed, for
greater robustness.




7.06 -> 7.07    (June 4, 2013)

Small change to builders that have discontinuities in their outputs,
to make them more predictable in the common case.




7.07 -> 7.08    (September 11, 2013)

Added history to the Sweeper.  Similar to the stimHistory in 
DataPro 6, but contains more information.




7.08 -> 7.09    (September 13, 2013)

Added more precise date/time information to acquired ADC waves.




7.09 -> 7.10    (October 11, 2013)

Made ramp builder slightly more flexible.




7.10 -> 7.11    (November 5, 2013)

Added white noise builder.
