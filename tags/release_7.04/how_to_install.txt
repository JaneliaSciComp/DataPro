How to install DataPro (on Windows)

If you don't need to also use older versions of DataPro:

-----
1. Copy the DataPro folder to the "User Procedures" (NOT "Igor
   Procedures") folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. Right-click on the "DataPro.ipf" file.  Select "Create Shortcut".
   Drag the newly-created file "Shortcut to DataPro.ipf" to the "Igor
   Procedures" folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

If you _do_ need to also use old (pre-version-7) versions of DataPro :

-----
1. Copy the DataPro folder to the "User Procedures" (NOT "Igor
   Procedures") folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. In experiments where you want to use this version of DataPro, add
   the line

     #include "DataPro"

   to the experiments procedure file.  You can access this from the
   Igor Pro menu by going to
   Windows > Procedure Windows > Procedure Window.  (Note: You will
   have to do this for each experiment and/or template that you want
   to use this version of DataPro with.)

If you want to use two post-version-7 versions of DataPro in parallel, 
I'm afraid there is no particularly good way to do that right now.  I 
suggest redoing your existing templates with the newer version of DataPro.

In either case, if DataPro is installed correctly, you should have a
menu item called "DataPro" in the Igor Pro main menu.

To start DataPro, select "Start" from the "DataPro" menu.


On a Mac, the installation procedure is similar, except that you have
to create aliases (option-click on the original to do this) instead of
shortcuts, and you have to modify the names of the aliases so that
they end with the same extension as the original, instead of ending in
"alias".  Additionally, you have to activate the GetInputState XOP.
You do this by creating an alias of

  /Applications/Igor Pro 6.2 Folder/More Extensions/Utilities/GetInputState.xop

and putting the alias in your Igor Extensions folder under your home
directory.  (You have to remove the " alias" from the name, also.)
