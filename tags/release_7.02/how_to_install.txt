How to install DataPro

If you don't need to also use older versions of DataPro:

-----
1. Copy DataPro folder to the "User Procedures" (NOT "Igor
   Procedures") folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. Right-click on the "DataPro.ipf" file.  Select "Create Shortcut".
   Drag the newly-created file "Shortcut to DataPro.ipf" to the "Igor
   Procedures" folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

If you _do_ need to also use older versions of DataPro:

-----
1. Copy DataPro folder to the "User Procedures" (NOT "Igor
   Procedures") folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. In experiments where you want to use this version of DataPro, add
   the line

     #include "DataPro"

   to the experiments procedure file.  You can access this from the
   Igor Pro menu by going to
   Windows > Procedure Windows > Procedure Window.  (Note: You will
   have to do this for each experiment and/or template that you want
   to use this version of DataPro with.)
-----

In either case, if DataPro is installed correctly, you should have a
menu item called "DataPro" in the Igor Pro main menu.

To start DataPro, select "Start DataPro" from the "DataPro" menu.
