How to install DataPro

If you don't need to also use older versions of DataPro:

-----
1. Copy DataPro folder to the "Igor Procedures" folder in your "Igor
   Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. Edit the file DataPro.ipf, changing the fourth line of the function
   StartDataPro() from

   NewPath DataPro "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Adam\\My
   Documents\\WaveMetrics\\Igor Pro 6 User Files\\User
   Procedures\\DataPro\\trunk\\"

   so that the path given points to the newly-installed DataPro
   folder, which will have a name similar to datapro_rel_700.  Be sure
   to use double backslashes (as above) to separate path elements on
   Microsoft Windows.

If you _do_ need to also use older versions of DataPro:

-----
1. Copy DataPro folder to the "User Procedures" (NOT "Igor
   Procedures") folder in your "Igor Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. Edit the file DataPro.ipf, changing the fourth line of the function
   StartDataPro() from

   NewPath DataPro "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Adam\\My
   Documents\\WaveMetrics\\Igor Pro 6 User Files\\User
   Procedures\\DataPro\\trunk\\"

   Microsoft Windows.

3. In experiments where you want to use this version of DataPro, add
   the line

     #include "DataPro"

   to the experiments procedure file.  You can access this from the
   Igor Pro menu by going to
   Windows > Procedure Windows > Procedure Window.  (Note: You will
   have to do this for each experiment and/or template that you want
   to use this version of DataPro with.)
-----

In either case, if DataPro is installed correctly, you should have a
menu item called "DataPro" in the Igor Pro main menu.

To start DataPro, select "Start DataPro" from the "DataPro" menu.
