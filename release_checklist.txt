Users: This is for the DataPro developer(s).  You can safely ignore
it.

Before tagging a release:

1. Update how_to_install.txt
2. Update changes.txt
3. Make sure copyright.txt covers the current year.

The how_to_install assumes you're doing to distribute the Github-made
.zip file for the release.  The file-naming convention is set by
Github.
