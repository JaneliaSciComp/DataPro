Before tagging a release:

1. Update "How to Install" section of the README.
2. Add an entry to the "Release History" section of the README.
3. Make sure the copyright notice in the README covers the current
   year.

The "How to Install" section assumes you're doing to distribute the
Github-made .zip file for the release.  The file-naming convention is
set by Github.
