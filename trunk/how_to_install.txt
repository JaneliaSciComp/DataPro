How to install DataPro

1. Copy DataPro folder in to the "User Procedures" folder in your "Igor
   Pro 6 User Files" folder.

2. Right-click on the DataPro.ipf file, select "Create Shortcut".
   This will create a file called "Shortcut to DataPro.ipf"

3. Copy the file "Shortcut to DataPro.ipf" to your "Igor Procedures"
   folder.

4. Edit the file DataPro.ipf, changing the fourth line of the function
   StartDataPro() from

   NewPath DataPro "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Adam\\My
   Documents\\WaveMetrics\\Igor Pro 6 User Files\\User
   Procedures\\DataPro\\trunk\\"

   so that the path given points to the newly-installed DataPro
   folder, which will have a name similar to datapro_rel_700.  Be sure
   to use double backslashes (as above) to separate path elements.

If DataPro is installed correctly, you should have a menu item called
"DataPro" in the Igor Pro main menu.

To start DataPro, select "Start DataPro" from the "DataPro" menu.
